Using a software tool to handle the versions of your project files
lets you focus on the more interesting/innovative aspects of your project.

*   Version control's advantages
    *   It's easy to set up
    *   Every copy of a Git repository is a full backup of a project and its history
    *   A few easy-to-remember commands are all you need for most day-to-day version control tasks
    *   The [GitHub][github] hosting service provides a web-based collaboration service
*   Two main concepts
    *   *commit*: a recorded set of changes in your project's files
    *   *repository*: the history of all your project's commits
*   Why use GitHub?
    *   No need for a server: easy to set up
    *   GitHub's strong community: your colleagues are probably already there

## Overall

Version control might be the most important topic we teach, but Git is
definitely the most complicated tool.  However, GitHub presently dominates the
open software repository landscape, so the time and effort required to teach
fundamental Git is justified and worthwhile.

Because of this complexity, we don't teach novice learners about many
interesting topics, such as branching, hashes, and commit objects.

Instead we try to convince them that version control is useful for researchers
working in teams or not, because it is

*   a better way to "undo" changes,
*   a better way to collaborate than mailing files back and forth, and
*   a better way to share your code and other scientific work with the world.

## Teaching Notes

*   You can "split" your shell so that recent commands remain in view using [this](https://github.com/rgaiacs/swc-shell-split-window) script.

*   Make sure the network is working *before* starting this lesson.

*   Drawings are particularly useful in this lesson: if you have a whiteboard,
    [use it][drawings]!

*   Version control is usually not the first subject in a workshop,
    so get learners to create a GitHub account after the session before.
    Remind learners that the username and email they use for GitHub (and setup
    during Git configuration) will be viewable to the public by default.
    However, there are many reasons why a learner may not want their personal
    information viewable, and GitHub has [resources for keeping an email address
    private][github-privacy].

*   If some learners are using Windows, there will inevitably be issues
    merging files with different line endings.  (Even if everyone's on
    some flavor of Unix, different editors may or may not add a
    newline to the last line of a file.) Take a moment to explain
    these issues, since learners will almost certainly trip over them
    again.  If learners are running into line ending problems, GitHub
    has a [page][github-line-endings] that helps with troubleshooting.
    Specifically, the [section on refreshing a repository][github-line-endings-refresh]
    may be helpful if learners need to change the `core.autocrlf` setting
    after already having made one or more commits.

*   We don't use a Git GUI in these notes because we haven't found one that
    installs easily and runs reliably on the three major operating systems, and
    because we want learners to understand what commands are being run.  That
    said, instructors should demo a GUI on their desktop at some point during
    this lesson and point learners at [this page][github-gui].

*   Instructors should show learners graphical diff/merge tools like
    [DiffMerge][diffmerge].

*   When appropriate, explain that we teach Git rather than CVS, Subversion, or
    Mercurial primarily because of GitHub's growing popularity: CVS and
    Subversion are now seen as legacy systems, and Mercurial isn't nearly as
    widely used in the sciences right now.

*   Further resources:
    *    [git-it][git-it] is a self-paced command-line Git demo,
         with [git-it-electron][git-it-electron] its GitHub Desktop successor.
    *    [Code School][code-school] has a free interactive course, [Try Git][try-git].
    *    for instructors, [the Git parable][git-parable] is useful background reading

## [Automated Version Control]({{ page.root }}{% link _episodes/01-basics.md %})

*   Ask, "Who uses 'undo' in their editor?" All say "Me". 'Undo' is the simplest
    form of version control.

*   Give learners a five-minute overview of what version control does for them
    before diving into the watch-and-do practicals.  Most of them will have
    tried to co-author papers by emailing files back and forth, or will have
    biked into the office only to realize that the USB key with last night's
    work is still on the kitchen table.  Instructors can also make jokes about
    directories with names like "final version", "final version revised",
    "final version with reviewer three's corrections", "really final version",
    and, "come on this really has to be the last version" to motivate version
    control as a better way to collaborate and as a better way to back work up.

## [Setting Up Git]({{ page.root }}{% link _episodes/02-setup.md %})

*   We suggest instructors and students use `nano` as the text editor for this
    lessons because

    *   it runs in all three major operating systems,
    *   it runs inside the shell (switching windows can be confusing to students), and
    *   it has shortcut help at the bottom of the window.

    Please point out to students during setup that they can and should use
    another text editor if they're already familiar with it.

*   When setting up Git, be very clear what learners have to enter: it is
    common for them to edit the instructor's details (e.g. email).  Check at
    the end using `git config --list`.

*   When setting up the default branch name, if learners have a Git version
    older than 2.28, the default branch name can be changed for the lesson
    using `git branch -M main` if there are currently commits in the repository,
    or `git checkout -b main` if there are no commits/the repository is completely empty.

## [Creating a Repository]({{ page.root }}{% link _episodes/03-create.md %})

*   When you do `git status`, Mac users may see a `.DS_Store` file showing as
    untracked. This a file that Mac OS creates in each directory.

*   The challenge "Places to create repositories" tries to reinforce the idea
    that the `.git` folder contains the whole Git repo and deleting this folder
    undoes a `git init`. It also gives the learner the way to fix the common
    mistake of putting unwanted folders (like `Desktop`) under version control.

    Instead of removing the `.git` folder directly, you can choose to move it
    first to a safer directory and remove it from there:

    ~~~
    $ mv .git temp_git
    $ rm -rf  temp_git
    ~~~
    {: .language-bash}

    The challenge suggests that it is a bad idea to create a Git repo inside another repo.
    For more discussion on this topic, please see [this issue][repos-in-repos].

## [Tracking Changes]({{ page.root }}{% link _episodes/04-changes.md %})

*   It's important that learners do a full commit cycle by themselves (make
    changes, `git diff`, `git add`, and `git commit`). The "`bio` repository"
    challenge does that.

*   This is a good moment to show a diff with a graphical diff tool. If you
    skip it because you're short on time, show it once in GitHub.

*   One thing may cause confusion is recovering old versions.  If, instead of
    doing `$ git checkout f22b25e mars.txt`, someone does `$ git checkout
    f22b25e`, they wind up in the "detached HEAD" state and confusion abounds.
    It's then possible to keep on committing, but things like `git push origin
    main` a bit later will not give easily comprehensible results.  It also
    makes it look like commits can be lost.  To "re-attach" HEAD, use
    `git checkout main`.

*   This is a good moment to show a log within a Git GUI. If you skip it
    because you're short on time, show it once in GitHub.

## [Ignoring Things]({{ page.root }}{% link _episodes/06-ignore.md %})

Just remember that you can use wildcards and regular expressions to ignore a
particular set of files in `.gitignore`.

## [Remotes in GitHub]({{ page.root }}{% link _episodes/07-github.md %})

*   Make it clear that Git and GitHub are not the same thing: Git is an open
    source version control tool, GitHub is a company that hosts Git
    repositories in the web and provides a web interface to interact with repos
    they host.

*   If your learners are advanced enough to be comfortable with SSH, tell them
    they can use keys to authenticate on GitHub instead of passwords, but don't
    try to set this up during class: it takes too long, and is a distraction
    from the core ideas of the lesson.

*   It is very useful to draw a diagram showing the different repositories
    involved.

*   When pushing to a remote, the output from Git can vary slightly depending on
    what leaners execute. The lesson displays the output from git if a learner
    executes `git push origin main`. However, some learners might use syntax
    suggested by GitHub for pushing to a remote with an existing repository,
    which is `git push -u origin main`. Learners using syntax from GitHub,
    `git push -u origin main`, will have slightly different output, including
    the line `Branch main set up to track remote branch main from origin by rebasing.`
